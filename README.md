- Files named `_` are placeholder files. They were created so empty directories could be committed.

By default, the site loads `app/views/pages/index.php`.

This MVC Framework is a simple, yet powerful PHP framework for web development. It follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components. This allows for efficient code organization, making it easier to maintain and scale. The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic; the View component is used for all the UI logic of the application; and the Controller acts as an interface between Model and View components, processing all the business logic and incoming requests. Modify and expand this framework according to your project's requirements.
